Predation was more intense in olive groves with a 0-value soil condition, indicating that lower intensity soil management and soil coverage by herbaceous vegetation favours predation.

Increasing predation rates were also registered in landscapes with increasing amounts of scrublands and scrublands mixed with oaks. Interactions between local and landscape factors were not significant at any date."
