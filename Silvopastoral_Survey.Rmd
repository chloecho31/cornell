Replace "si" or "no" answers with corresponding score value.

- Regeneration = 1 h1_1_3  
- Planting trees = 2 h1_1_4 
- Live fences = 2 
- Silvopastoral = 3
- Forage banks = 3
- No = 0 for all of the questions


```{r}

df <- mutate(df, id = case_when(id == 30 ~ 40, TRUE ~ id))

```

Create column for proportion of land cover by the practice. 

Multiply score by proportion. 

Sum together individual question scores into a cummulative score for the farm's silvopastoral intensity.
